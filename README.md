**2.	Game Description**

      A player will be given a random number at the start of the game.  Each of the four crystals has 
      a hidden value, which will only be revealed when clicked.  
      
      With each click, the crystal’s value is added to the player’s total score.  If the total score 
      matches the random number, the player wins the game.  If the total score exceeds the random 
      number, the player loses the game.  
      
      The game tracks the player’s wins and losses.  After each round, the game resets and another 
      randomly generated number will appear.  The game then starts again.
